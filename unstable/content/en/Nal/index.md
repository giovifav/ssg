A little pirate game. Sail, plunder, survive! Made for gdevelop 3d jam.

Instructions:

Sail with wasd, throw cannonballs with arrow keys, fish with space to boost your crew's morale and go faster. loot the loot near your ship with space.

Information:

In the jam version a bug does not allow you to die and on some mobile devices there may be problems with resolution.

Being my first game with gdevelop I am quite happy with the result.
