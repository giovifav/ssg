Hello, I'm Giovanni Favaro.
Welcome! This is my digital workshop, where I collect and share my software creations. As a hobbyist programmer, I'm driven by curiosity and a passion for building, which has led me to explore a diverse range of projectsâ€”from developer tools to retro-style games.

I've just released my latest project, [Whisperli](https://giovifav.github.io/whisperli/), an ambient sound mixer built to help you find your perfect soundscape for work or relaxation.
